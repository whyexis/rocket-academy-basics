# Rocket Academy Basics Course Demo

A demo of the apps coded from [Rocket Academy Coding Basics Course](https://www.rocketacademy.co/courses/basics) and a [journal](journal.md) of takeaways.

Over six weeks, the course uses a flipped classroom format that prompts students towards a general direction to figure things out on their own. The course exercises taught coding principles while three assigned projects allowed students to apply their learnings.
